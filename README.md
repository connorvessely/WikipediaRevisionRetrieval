project1 

We created a functional program to take input from a user 
and display a list of up to 30 of the most recent revisions 
to that Wikipedia page with a GUI.

The entry to the console application can be found in the project tab by: 
project1-> src-> main-> java-> edu.bs.cs222-> Main-> run Main.main()

The entry for the GUI is found in the Gradle tab by:
project1-> Tasks-> application-> run

Ignored warnings about author and timestamp being final and 
warnings within the class itself due to WikipediaRevisionReader 
requirements.
